# KarmaPay account setup

Welcome to KarmaPay! This guide will walk you through the steps to get started, including creating your developer account and setting up your payment gateways.

## Step 1: Create Your Developer Account

To begin using KarmaPay, you first need to create a developer account. Follow these simple steps:

1. Go to [KarmaPay Sign Up](https://karmapay.live/signup).
2. Fill in the required fields with your information.
3. Click on the `Sign Up` button to create your account.

Once you've successfully signed up, you'll have access to the KarmaPay dashboard where you can manage your payment gateways, view transactions, and customize your settings.

## Step 2: Configure Your Payment Gateways

After creating your developer account, the next step is to configure your payment gateways. KarmaPay supports multiple payment gateways like Razorpay, Stripe, and PhonePe. Here's how to set them up:

1. Navigate to [Settings](https://karmapay.live/settings) in your KarmaPay dashboard.
2. Under the **Basic Details** section, enter your Name, Business Name, and Domain Name.
3. Scroll down to the **API Keys** section where you can enter the API keys for your selected payment gateways (Razorpay, Stripe, and PhonePe).
    - Ensure you have accounts with these payment providers and have generated API keys from their respective dashboards.

## Step 3: Generate Your KarmaPay API Key

To interact with the KarmaPay API, you'll need a KarmaPay API Key (KAPI). Here's how to create one:

1. Still on the [Settings](https://karmapay.live/settings) page, locate the section for generating a KarmaPay API Key.
2. Click on the `Generate API Key` button. This key will be used to authenticate your application's requests to KarmaPay.
3. Securely store your KAPI key; you'll need it for all API requests.

## Next Steps

With your account set up and your payment gateways configured, you're ready to start integrating KarmaPay into your application. Proceed to the **Integration Guide** section for detailed instructions on implementing the unified API and making your first payment request.
