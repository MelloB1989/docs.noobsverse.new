# Generating a Stripe API Keys

To use Stripe with KarmaPay, you'll need to generate a Stripe API key. This key enables KarmaPay to initiate transactions and process payments via Stripe. Follow the below steps to generate your Stripe API key:

## Step 1: Sign In to Stripe

- Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login) and log in to your account.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Developers Section

- After logging in, click on `Developers` in the top menu.
- Then, select `API Keys` from the sidebar.

## Step 3: Generate API Key

- If you havenâ€™t already created an API key, click on `Create Secret Key`.
- Once your API keys are generated, you will see both a publishable key and a secret key. Copy these keys and store them securely.
