# Work Flow of KarmaPay

KarmaPay is designed to simplify the integration of multiple payment gateways into your application, providing a unified, secure, and efficient way to handle online payments. Here's an overview of the workflow and how you can leverage KarmaPay for your payment processing needs.

## Overview

KarmaPay acts as a "payment gateway of payment gateways," abstracting away the complexities involved in integrating and managing multiple payment gateways. By interfacing with KarmaPay, developers can use a single API endpoint to access a variety of payment services. This approach minimizes the client-side code needed for payment integration, shifting most of the payment handling logic to the server side, where it can be managed more securely and efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Store API Keys

- Initially, KarmaPay requires you to store the necessary API keys for all the payment gateways you intend to use. This is a one-time setup process that ensures secure communication between KarmaPay and the payment providers.
- API keys can be configured through the settings page at [KarmaPay Settings](https://karmapay.live/settings).

### Step 2: Create an Order

- To initiate a payment, developers use the KarmaPay `Create Order API` to generate a new order. This action creates a dedicated payment page hosted on the payment domain, which needs to be specified in your settings on KarmaPay.
- **Note:** For detailed information on how to use the Create Order API, refer to the [KarmaPay API Documentation](#).

### Step 3: Redirect the Customer

- Once an order is created, a payment page is dynamically generated in the format `<user_domain>/payments/(order_id)`. You will need to redirect your customer to this page for them to complete their payment.
- This dedicated payment page is designed to handle all aspects of the payment process securely and efficiently.


### Step 4: Payment Completion and Cleanup

- After the payment is completed, the payment page is automatically deleted, ensuring that no sensitive information is retained longer than necessary.

## Benefits of Using KarmaPay

- **Simplified Integration:** A single API endpoint replaces multiple integrations, saving time and reducing complexity.
- **Enhanced Security:** By handling payments server-side and following best practices, KarmaPay ensures the secure processing of transactions.
- **Scalability:** KarmaPay's architecture is built to handle growing transaction volumes, making it suitable for businesses of all sizes.
- **Flexibility:** Easily switch between different payment gateways or add new ones without altering your application's codebase.

KarmaPay streamlines the payment process, making it easier for developers to integrate multiple payment gateways and for customers to make payments seamlessly. By centralizing payment gateway management, KarmaPay offers a robust solution for businesses looking to expand their payment options and enhance their security posture.
