```

## Request Body

The request must be in JSON format and include the following fields:

- `subscription_id`: The ID of the subscription (e.g., `"ftx0li8efd"`).
- `start_date`: The start date of the subscription in `DD/MM/YYYY` format (e.g., `"27/11/2004"`).
- `end_date`: The end date of the subscription in `DD/MM/YYYY` format (e.g., `"27/11/2004"`).

  "subscription_id": "ftx0li8efd",
  "start_date": "27/11/2004",
  "end_date": "27/11/2004"
}
```

## Response

The API will return a JSON response with the details of the user subscription. The structure and content of the response will depend on the specific implementation details and data available.

## Notes

- Ensure that the Bearer Token is valid and has not expired before making a request.
- Dates in the request body should follow the `DD/MM/YYYY` format to avoid errors.
