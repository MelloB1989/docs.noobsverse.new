# API Documentation: getAllBikes

The `getAllBikes` API endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all bikes available in the system. This is an HTTP GET request that requires bearer token authentication.

## Endpoint Details

- **HTTP Method**: GET
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/v1/bikes/get`

## Authentication

This endpoint requires a bearer token for authentication. You must include the token in the request header to successfully access the endpoint.

- **Authentication Type**: Bearer Token
- **Token**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJwaG9uZSI6Iis5MTk4MTI5NDA3MDYiLCJ1aWQiOiJhZnJ3dXZkXzFqIn0.se2WRRJhST9uvOyhTwunvJiiMYD-RYfKqfXPMN2NnE0`

## Request

The request to this endpoint does not require a request body. All necessary authentication must be provided via the bearer token in the request headers.

## Response

A successful response will typically contain a list of bike objects. The structure and details of these objects depend on the server's exact implementation and data schema.

## Example Request

```http
GET /v1/bikes/get HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJwaG9uZSI6Iis5MTk4MTI5NDA3MDYiLCJ1aWQiOiJhZnJ3dXZkXzFqIn0.se2WRRJhST9uvOyhTwunvJiiMYD-RYfKqfXPMN2NnE0
```

Ensure that you replace the provided token with a valid one issued by your authentication server, as this example token might be expired or invalid for your use.

## Example Response

A successful response might look like this:

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "id": "bike_123",
    "model": "Mountain Master",
    "brand": "CyclePro",
    "available": true
  },
  {
    "id": "bike_456",
    "model": "City Explorer",
    "brand": "Urban Bikes",
    "available": false
  }
]
```

## Error Handling

Should the request fail, possible error responses include:

- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing authentication token.
- **404 Not Found**: If the endpoint does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: If an unexpected error occurs on the server side.
