## Login API

### Overview

The **Login** API is an HTTP service enabling users to authenticate by sending the required information in the request body without the need for prior authorization headers.

### Endpoint

**HTTP Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `https://ev-backend.app.k8s.coffeecodes.in/v1/auth/login`

### Request

#### Headers

The following header must be included in the request:

- `X-Karma-Admin-Auth`: `ajbkbakweiuy387yeuqqwfahdjhsabd`

#### Body

The request body should be in JSON format. An example of the required body is as follows:

```json
{
  "phone": "+919812940706"
}
```

### Authentication

No authentication is required to access the Login API.

### Example Request

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="cURL" default>

```bash
curl -X POST https://ev-backend.app.k8s.coffeecodes.in/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Karma-Admin-Auth: ajbkbakweiuy387yeuqqwfahdjhsabd" \
  -d '{
    "phone": "+919812940706"
  }'
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Response

Upon success, you will receive a response with authentication information (exact details of the response are subject to the implementation and are not detailed here).

### Notes

- The phone number in the request body must follow the international format, as shown in the example.
- Ensure that the `X-Karma-Admin-Auth` header is correctly set for authentication purposes.
