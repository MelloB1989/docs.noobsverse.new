## verifyOTP

### Overview

The `verifyOTP` API allows you to verify a one-time password (OTP) that a user has received on their phone. This endpoint is typically used in the authentication flow to validate user identity through their mobile number.

### HTTP Request

#### Method: POST
#### URL: `http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/verify_otp`

### Request Headers

- No authentication is required for this endpoint.

### Request Body

The request body should be in JSON format and contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "phone": "+919812940706",
  "otp": "815897"
}
```

#### Body Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                        |
|-----------|--------|------------------------------------|
| phone     | string | The mobile number to verify.       |
| otp       | string | The OTP received to verify.        |

### Sample Request

```json
POST http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/verify_otp
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "phone": "+919812940706",
  "otp": "815897"
}
```

### Response

Upon successful verification, the server will return a status response indicating the result of the verification process. The details of the response structure should be then defined by the API implementer.

### Use Case Sequence

1. User requests an OTP to be sent to their mobile number.
2. User receives the OTP via SMS.
3. User submits the OTP along with their phone number to the verifyOTP endpoint.
4. The endpoint validates the OTP and responds with the result.

This API is typically called during the second step of a multi-factor authentication process to ensure the user's phone number is verified before proceeding further in the authentication flow.
