# verifyOTP API

## Overview

The `verifyOTP` API is used to verify a one-time password (OTP) sent to a user's phone number. This is typically part of an authentication process to ensure secure and verified access.

## HTTP Request

- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/v1/auth/verify_otp`
- **Authentication**: None required

## Request Body

The body of the request should be in JSON format and must contain the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type   | Description                      |
|-----------|--------|----------------------------------|
| `phone`   | string | The user's phone number including country code. Example: `+919812940706`. |
| `otp`     | string | The OTP received by the user. Example: `815897`. |

### Example Request Body

```json
{
  "phone": "+919812940706",
  "otp": "815897"
}
```

## Sequence

This API request is the second step in the authentication sequence.

## Response

The response will depend on the implementation and isn't specified here, but it typically indicates whether the OTP verification was successful or not.

## Usage

To use the verifyOTP endpoint, ensure that you have the correct phone number and OTP that corresponds to a previously initiated authentication session. This typically follows a process where an OTP was sent to the user's phone number via an SMS or another channel.

Ensure your request is correctly formatted in JSON and sent via a POST method to the specified URL.

## Error Handling

Errors may include invalid OTP, expired OTP, or wrong phone number format. Proper error messages should guide the endpoint consumer to rectify the request data.
