```

### Required Authentication

This API requires a bearer token for access. Ensure that the token is correctly included in the header of your HTTP request as shown above.

### Response

The response will contain user trips ordered by the slowest speed. The number of trips returned is determined by the `limit` parameter. The data structure of the response is not detailed here and should be determined from the specific implementation or additional documentation.

### Error Handling

In cases of authentication failure, or if the required bearer token is not provided, the API will return an appropriate error message with a status code indicating what went wrong (such as 401 Unauthorized).

### Example Request

```http
GET /v1/trips/speed/slowest?limit=10 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
```

### Notes

- Ensure your bearer token is valid and current to successfully authenticate your request.
- Modify the `limit` query parameter as needed to get more or fewer records, but the default value is set to `10`.

This is a private endpoint and should be used carefully following the provided authentication methods to ensure secure operations.
