# API Documentation: getStation

## Overview

The `getStation` API is an HTTP endpoint designed to retrieve details about a specific station. This endpoint does not require any body parameters or authentication mechanisms. However, it does require specific headers to be included in the request.

## HTTP GET Request

### URL

```
http://localhost:3000/v1/stations/get/wxyoqxff83
```

### Method

```
GET
```

### Body

```

## Request Headers

| Header Name              | Value                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `X-Karma-Admin-Auth`     | `ajbkbakweiuy387yeuqqwfahdjhsabd`     |

Ensure that the `X-Karma-Admin-Auth` header is included in the request, as it is required for the endpoint to properly authenticate and process the request.

## Authentication

## Example Request

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/v1/stations/get/wxyoqxff83
