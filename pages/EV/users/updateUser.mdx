- **Method**: `POST`
- **Content Type**: `application/json`

## Authentication

```json
{
  "age": "69",
  "weight": "86"
}
```

- **age**: The age of the user.
- **weight**: The weight of the user.

## Sequence

This API call is part of a sequence of operations, positioned as step number 4 in a series.

## Example Request

Hereâ€™s an example request using the `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/user/update \
-H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJwaG9uZSI6Iis5MTk4MTI5NDA3MDYiLCJ1aWQiOiI1Z2VhcGdhcHhzIn0.yNyKfoOQouzSNDwp_5rJ9CAEMVJo5uqueJHNpG-a3Aw" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "age": "69",
  "weight": "86"
}'
```

Ensure that the Bearer token is valid and has the necessary permissions for the update operation.

## Notes

- Make sure to replace the hardcoded Bearer token with a dynamically generated one when implementing this in a production environment.
- The response of the API call will typically indicate the success or failure of the update operation.
