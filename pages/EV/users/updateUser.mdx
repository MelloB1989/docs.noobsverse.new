## Usage

To call the `updateUser` endpoint, construct a POST request to the specified URL, include the bearer token in the headers for authorization, and pass the JSON object containing the user's age and weight in the request body.

## Notes

- Ensure that the bearer token is kept secure to prevent unauthorized access.
- Parameters such as user's age and weight should be appropriately validated before sending the request.
- Check server response codes and messages for successful operation and error handling.
