# joinGroup API Reference

The `joinGroup` API allows a user to join a specific group. This is done via an HTTP POST request to a specified URL with bearer token authentication.

## HTTP Request

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/v1/groups/vDLvtaMVs7zAVXZWkX0lL/join`
- **Body**: None, the request does not require a body.
- **Authentication**: Bearer token

## Authentication

To authenticate the request, a valid bearer token must be included in the request header. The structure of the header is as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Example Token

```plaintext
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJwaG9uZSI6Iis5MTk4MTI5NDA3MDYiLCJ1aWQiOiI1Z2VhcGdhcHhzIn0.yNyKfoOQouzSNDwp_5rJ9CAEMVJo5uqueJHNpG-a3Aw
```

## Example Request

```http
POST /v1/groups/vDLvtaMVs7zAVXZWkX0lL/join HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJwaG9uZSI6Iis5MTk4MTI5NDA3MDYiLCJ1aWQiOiI1Z2VhcGdhcHhzIn0.yNyKfoOQouzSNDwp_5rJ9CAEMVJo5uqueJHNpG-a3Aw
```

## Response

Upon successful request, the server will process the join group action. The specifics of the response (such as status codes and any response body) are determined by the server implementation and are not covered in this reference.

## Notes

- Ensure that the bearer token is valid and corresponds to an authorized user.
- This API does not require any body content in the request.
- Follow security best practices to handle and store the bearer tokens securely.
